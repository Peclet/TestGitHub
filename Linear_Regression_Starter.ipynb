        "\n",
        "Here are some things to keep in mind throughout this exercise:\n",
        "\n",
        "- There is an important distinction between python arrays (called `list` or `tuple`) and `numpy` arrays. You should use `numpy` arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix operations work only with `numpy` arrays. Python lists do not support vector operations (you need to use for loops).\n",
        "\n",
        "- If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of `numpy` arrays using the `shape` property will help you debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "- By default, `numpy` interprets math operators to be element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you need to use the `dot` function in `numpy` or the @ symbol. For, example if `A` and `B` are two `numpy` matrices, then the matrix operation AB is `np.dot(A, B)`. Note that for 2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also equivalent to `A@B` (requires python >= 3.5).\n",
        "\n",
        "- To quickly learn more about the `matplotlib` plot function and what arguments you can provide to it, you can type `?plt.plot` in a cell within the Jupyter notebook. This opens a separate page showing the documentation for the requested function. You can also search online for plotting documentation. "
